# Comp-Class-Project
This is our Workspace for the Computer Programming Class Project</br>
This should help us organize the project for our computer science class at the CRI.<br>
Our project will be divided into three parts. Each of us can contribute by writing functions.<br>
<b>At the moment, the division of work is organized as follows:<b></br>
<br><b>Jason</b></br>
Make a GitHub</br>
Make a list of bacterial species</br>
Classify each one as slow or fast growing (Wikipedia?), or based on generation time if we can find it</br>
Download the genome data for each species</br>
</br><b>Blazenka</b></br>
Determine G+C content</br>
Put it on the graph</br>
Use this to find the origin of replication</br>

<b>Paul</b></br>
Determine location of dnaA boxes in the chromosome (5’ -TTATNCACA – 3’)
Determine location of dnaA ( put it on the graph)</br>
Determine location of dnaA relative to origin of replication</br>
*Find if there is a correlation between location and “lifestyle”</br>
